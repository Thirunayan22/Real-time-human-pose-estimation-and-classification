# Real-time-human-pose-estimation-and-classification
Human pose estimation is an increasingly used area in augmentation, tracking and human behavior prediction with many different solutions and methods. Availability of the two state of the art datasets namely MPII Human Pose dataset in 2015 and COCO keypoint dataset in 2016 gave a real boost to develop this field and pushed researchers to develop state of the art libraries for pose estimation of multiple people in a video using camera. One such state of the art library is OpenPose which is a real-time multi person system to detect keypoints. Using BODY_25 model, we get 25 body part key-points. We install this library on NVidia Jetson TX2 controller for mobile robotics task and develop a code that recognizes four poses of human (Standing, sitting, saying hello and stop) on the video being captured by Full HD USB video camera.

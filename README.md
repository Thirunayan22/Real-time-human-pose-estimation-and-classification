# Real-time-human-pose-estimation-and-classification using OpenPose
This repository explains how OpenPose can be used for human pose estimation and activity classification. Availability of the two state of the art datasets namely [MPII Human Pose dataset] (http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#download) in 2015 and [COCO keypoint dataset] (http://cocodataset.org/#home) in 2016 gave a real boost to develop this field and pushed researchers to develop state of the art libraries for pose estimation of multiple people in a video using camera. One such state of the art library is OpenPose which is a real-time multi person system to detect keypoints. Using BODY_25 model, we get 25 body part key-points. We install this library on NVidia Jetson TX2 controller for mobile robotics task and develop a code that recognizes four poses of human (Standing, sitting, saying hello and stop) on the video being captured by Full HD USB video camera.
## Why OpenPose ?
OpenPose is a very efficient library in terms of running time and accuracy because other algorithms fail when number of people in the image is increased. The below figure  shows comparative performance of OpenPose with two other state of the art pose estimation libraries which are [AlphaPose](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose) and [Mask R-CNN] (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN). AlphaPose performs good when there are less than 5 people in the image but as the number of people increase, it becomes computationally expensive.
